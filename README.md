# React-CRUD
The Git repository contains a React application for a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation on a list of suppliers. The application provides a user interface to manage supplier data, including adding new suppliers, viewing the existing ones in a tabular format, and deleting suppliers.
The main entry point of the application is the App component, which handles the state for the search query and passes it to the MyTable component for filtering the supplier data based on the search query. The App component uses Chakra UI components for styling, including an input field for the search query and a button to trigger the search.

The MyTable component is responsible for fetching and displaying the supplier data. It makes an API call to retrieve supplier information using the network module from "../network/lib/supplier." It uses the useEffect hook to load the data when the component mounts. The MyTable component also contains functionality for deleting suppliers and a modal for adding new suppliers.

The Navbar component provides the navigation bar at the top of the application. It includes responsive behavior for mobile and desktop views and allows users to search for suppliers using the search bar. The navigation items are dynamically filtered based on the search query.

The application uses Chakra UI for styling, which provides a visually appealing and responsive design. It leverages React Hook Form for form handling in the modal for adding new suppliers.

Overall, the Git repository showcases an example of a CRUD application built with React, Chakra UI, and React Hook Form. Developers can use this code as a starting point to understand how to manage state, make API calls, and handle forms in a React application while maintaining a modern and user-friendly interface using Chakra UI components.
